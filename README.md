# HaltingProblem
Focus on the proof of undecidability of halting problem.
Using the computation model - WHILE language.

Folder While/* contains the definition, syntax and semantic of the WHILE language.
Folder Universal/* contains the method to code and decode the program in WHILE language,
                            and the proof of the correctness of the universal WHILE program.
Folder HaltingProblem/* contains the proof of the undecidability of halting problem by contradiction.
                        which is, assume there exists some machine that could decide the halting problem,
                        then, proof the contradictory.
