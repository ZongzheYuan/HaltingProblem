The \wit{Halting Problem}, is a famous problem in the computability theory.
Alan Turing proved the undecidability of the \wit{Halting Problem} in 1936\cite{jones_computability_1997}.
By choosing some computational models which are \wit{Turing-equivalents} to the \wit{Turing Machine}\cite{copeland_church-turing_2002}, defining the syntax and semantics of that model and
constructing the universal computational model based on the theory of \wit{Turing-complete}, one could prove the undecidability of the \wit{Halting Problem}.
The aim of this project is constructing a proper computational model, proving the correctness of the universal model (has the property of \wit{Turing completeness}), and finally using that model to prove the undecidability of the \wit{Halting Problem}.
In more details, the project will develop a machine checked proof of the undecidability of the \wit{Halting Problem} using the \Agda system.
