The \wit{Halting Problem}, is a famous problem in computability theory, proved by Alan Turing in 1936 \cite{jones_computability_1997}.
By choosing some computational model which is \wit{Turing-equivalents} to the \wit{Turing machine}\cite{copeland_church-turing_2002}, defining the syntax and semantics of that model,
constructing the universal computation model by the theory of \wit{Turing-complete}, one could proof the undecidability of the \wit{Halting Problem}.
The aim of the project is constructing a proper computational model, proving the correctness of the universal model (the property of \wit{Turing completeness}), and finally using that model to prove the undecidability of \wit{halting problem} by contradiction.
