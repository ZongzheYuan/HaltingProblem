Some People helped with the preparation of the paper. 
Three in particular have made significant contributions to the content of the paper, the style of the paper, as well as the code of the proof in \Agda:
Gabe Dijkstra helped a lot with the professional \Agda technique.
Ambrus Kaposi helped significantly with many proofs and several lemmas involving some key point in the proof of the correctness of the universal model and the proof of Halting Problem.
Thorsten Altenkirch, as the supervisor of the project, provided the overview and the general idea of the proof of the Halting Problem in \textbf{Agda}, and helped me a lot during the whole project.\\
Part of the definition, including the definition of \WHILE language used in the project follows the definition in the paper \wit{Computability and complexity: from a programming perspective} by \wit{Jones, Neil D} in 1997\cite{jones_computability_1997}.
